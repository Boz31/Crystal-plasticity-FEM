# Crystal-plasticity-FEM
This repository presents a CPFEM (Crystal Plasticity Finite Element Method) model for simulating realistic microstructure evolution, implemented in ABAQUS with a UMAT subroutine.
The UMAT code is based on the implementation developed by Eralp Demir.
This repository only provides a method for processing and importing EBSD (.ctf) files.
Some key parts have been removed or modified, but I can provide the full code upon request—please contact me via email if needed.
If you use this code, please cite Eralp Demir’s work. Many thanks again to Eralp Demir for his valuable contribution.
